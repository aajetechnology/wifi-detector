🎯 Project Vision & Mission
Vision Statement
"To create the world's most accessible WiFi security platform that automatically protects every user from network threats before they connect."

Core Mission
Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that instantly analyzes any WiFi network, warns users before connecting to dangerous hotspots, and automatically protects them with built-in VPN when threats are detected.

📱 Project Type & Platform Strategy
Aspect	Specification
Project Type	Progressive Web App (PWA)
Target Platforms	All modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
Primary Focus	Mobile-first design, installable, works offline
Deployment	Web-based - no app store dependencies
🎯 KEY DECISION: We are web-only - no native Android/iOS apps to maximize accessibility and reduce development overhead.

🚀 Core Features - Finalized Scope
1. WiFi Scanning & Analysis
🔍 Real-time Network Intelligence

Scan all nearby networks with detailed metadata

Data Captured: SSID, BSSID, signal strength (RSSI), channel, frequency bands (2.4/5/6 GHz)

Security Analysis: Open/WEP/WPA/WPA2/WPA3/Enterprise detection

Standards Identification: Wi-Fi protocol version detection

2. Security Analysis Engine
🛡️ Threat Detection System

Detect open, WEP, weak, or evil-twin networks

Identify known rogue/phishing hotspots (crowdsourced + curated database)

Real-time Risk Scoring: Safe / Risky / Dangerous classification

Continuous threat intelligence updates

3. Smart Auto-Protection
⚡ Instant Defense Mechanisms

Big warning modal before connecting to risky networks

Instant alerts + auto-disconnect when attacks detected while connected

Auto-activate Guardian VPN on untrusted networks

VPN Technology: WebRTC + WireGuard-in-browser or partner tunnel integration

4. Live Connection Insights
